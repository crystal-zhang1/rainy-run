# PROJECT TITLE: Rainy Run
VERSION: 1.0.0

AUTHOR: Crystal Zhang

## PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
Simulation on the Greenfoot IDE to see if you stay more dry moving faster or slower in the rain (from point A to point B). 

## USER INSTRUCTIONS:
When the program is running, rows of raindrops will start falling down and the person (represented by the box) will start moving at a constant speed when the first row of raindrops hit the ground. As the person moves from the shelter they start in towards the other shelter, the number in the middle of the person will count the number of raindrops that touches the person.

In the class MyWorld, the speed of the person (BOX_SPEED) and speed of the wind (WIND-SPEED) can be changed to simulate different scenarios. Increasing the person's speed will make them go faster. Positive wind speed will make raindrops fall at an angle (in the same direction as the person is travelling). Negative wind speed will make the rain fall at an angle against the person.

The length of the world (WORLD_WIDTH) can also be increased.
